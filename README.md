This repository contains a deep learning solution for accurately segmenting water bodies from 12-channel multispectral satellite data. The project uses a U-Net architecture implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. This work was completed as part of a project for **Cellula Technologies**.

## Project Objective
The goal is to develop a robust solution vital for monitoring water resources, flood management, and environmental conservation, where precise segmentation of water bodies can significantly impact decision-making.

## 📊 Performance Summary

The model was trained for 25 epochs, with `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint` callbacks monitoring the validation IoU. The best weights were restored from **Epoch 22**, which achieved the highest validation IoU. The final performance metrics from this epoch are summarized below:

| Metric             | Training Set | Validation Set |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| **IoU**            | 0.789        | **0.756**      |
| **Loss**           | 0.179        | 0.207          |
| **Accuracy**       | 0.935        | 0.938          |
| **Precision**      | 0.905        | 0.859          |
| **Recall**         | 0.860        | 0.863          |

## ⚙️ Usage

1.  **Download the Dataset:** You will need to acquire the `Water Segmentation.zip` dataset and place it in a relevant project directory.

2.  **Update Paths:** Modify the paths inside `train.py` to point to your dataset location.

3.  **Run the Training Script:**
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
    The script will perform data cleaning, build the U-Net model, train it, and save the best-performing model as `best_water_segmentation_model.keras`.
